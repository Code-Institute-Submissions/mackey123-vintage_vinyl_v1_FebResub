Welcome mackey123,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!

 # Testing

## To test my code I did it in the following way
- I ran the code through the different validators for each of my languages.
- I would copy sections of code so as not to do a whole page and fix any problems within the section first.

- Paste the code into the correct tester.

- Once results and errors (if present) are visble, examine and correct the changes needed.

- Repeated the same process for all the languages.

## I would browse through the site on all the different types of view port to ensure it worked well.

- I would browse through all of the site on the mobile and tablet viewports.

- I check all the links to make sure they worked correctly, I looked at the text content to make sure it came out the way intended.

- I would then make sure that all the correct text is visble and not too small, then I would interact with all the interactive elements to make sure they reacted correctly.

- Open google tools and view any errors present.

- Correct the changes if needed.

 ## I also viewed the site on different browsers to see how it reacted.

- I would open up a diffrent browser be it be it mozilla,internet explorer or google.

- I would interact and click all the links available to make sure they worked.

- Interact with all interactive elements and code to make sure it ran they way its supposed to.

## Security Testing
All pages were tested to make sure that no unauthorised users can access pages they should not have access to. If a user is logged out, they have no access to any pages they should not have access to. All admin only pages can only be accessed by the admin. Redirects are all working as expected, with correct flash messages present.

## Testing user stories

- Navigate easy through all devices and have all areas of website responsive.
- The site is fully responsive regardless of device used, and the navbar is clear and easy to navigate through on both mobile and desktop/laptop devices.

- To be able to view/preview the site before creating an account.
Users will have full access to the vinyls available on site, they may not purchase until they have a account.

- Have clear Registration and Log In pages.
The registration and log in pages are clearly marked within the navbar, they are also linked on the home page, and are set as redirections for certain actions on the site if the user is not logged in.

To be able to view book reviews
All viewers can view the book reviews regardless of having a account or not.

Have the ability to add their own reviews and keep a record of them.
Once a user has registered an account, they will easily be able to add their own book reviews. The add book review link is in the navbar so is accessible from any page in the site.

To be able to edit and delete reviews posted.
Once a book review has been submitted, the user who created the review will be able to edit and delete the review easily. There are buttons that link the user to these pages from the book review itself only if they have a account and they added the book review.

For the review information to be clear and concise.
The review information is laid out clearly and users are shown very quickly what the site is about.

To be able to securely log out of the site.
There is a clear Log Out header which appears in the navbar for users who are logged in .

Find links to other sites and ares to purchase books.
Under the book reviews on the base page there is links to other sites.

To be provided with contact information and social links.
There is a contact form under the "Contact Us" link in the navbar. We have also added a email in the footer if a user would like to contact that way.

To store date securely
The admin and user are both able to store their data which is sent to a mongo datebase, the passwords are salted to add more security and stop brute forcing.

Bugs, problems and points to consider
After using the Google dev tools to help correct any mistakes in my code I came across a error of "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)" so i added a "link rel="shortcut icon" href="#" into the head of my html pages.

materialize was not allowing my side nav components to be clicked on to fix this I had to get rid of the opacity on my background image.

I had to change a max width for containers to organise the styling of the code a lot more.

Could not get a max lenght and min lenght on my book rating section so I left it as only a number input but a label for out of ten.

Found only errors for my jinja templating in all my html.

In future I would implement a better card system for the books without the use of materialize.

Deployment
To deploy my Project to Github do it following these steps

Open up your Github and navigate to your repository.

Under the Repository section click settings.

Locate Git hub pages by scrolling down and underneath it click the drop-down menu to select a folder for your publishing source.

Click save and locate the link under the same section and click into the site.

Heroku
This project is deployed using Heroku. I done it in the following way

Within GitPod, create the .gitignore and env.py files.

In the .gitignore file, set it to ignore the env.py file and pycache/ directory.

Within the env.py file, set the following environmental variable:

os.environ.setdefault(“IP”, “0.0.0.0”)

os.environ.setdefault(“PORT”, “5000”)

os.environ.setdefault(“SECRET_KEY”, “YOUR_SECRET_KEY”)

os.environ.setdefault(“MONGO_URI”, “mongo db link to go here”)

os.environ.setdefault(“MONGO_DBNAME”, “YOUR_DATABASE_NAME”)

Make sure that the env.py file has been saved correctly and open the app.py file.

Import OS, Flask and the env.py file.

Create a requirements.txt file by typing in the terminal; pip3 freeze –local > requirements.txt.

For Heroku, you will also need a Procfile. Create this by using the terminal and typing; echo web: python app.py > Procfile.

Access the Procfile and delete the bottom empty line to avoid any issues in the future.

Go to the Heroku site, and log in or create a profile. From the dashboard, select “New App”.

Create a name for your app, select the correct region and click “Create App”.

Navigate over to the “Deploy” tab and go to the “Deployment method” section. Click on GitHub.

Search for your repository name, and click “Connect” next to your repository name.

Next, go to the “Settings” tab, and scroll down to “Config Vars”. Click “Reveal config vars”.

Enter the Key and Value pairs as per your env.py file; IP : 0.0.0.0 PORT : 5000 SECRET_KEY : YOUR_SECRET_KEY MONGO_URI : “mongo db link to go here” MONGO_DBNAME : “your database name”

Finally, go back to the “Deploy” tab, and scroll down to “Automatic deploys”. Click on “Enable Automatic Deploys” then “Deploy Branch”. The app will now be built and upon completion, you will receive a message saying “Your app was successfully deployed”.

You can now click on “Open App” which will launch the deployed app.

Changes made after deployment
Site was deployed early from heroku before starting acctual code.

Run code locally
To run my code locally follow these steps: Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository

Under the repo name click Clone.
