He became known for his intensive sampling and remixing technique that involves “cross-hatching brief snatches of vocals into a melodic-percussive honeycomb of blissful hiccups” as described by critic Simon Reynolds. Used both on his solo albums and on his remixes for other artists, this complex vocal sampling technique in some cases renders the original track almost unrecognizable.

Comparing their stylistic approach to their previous album, band member Thomas Bangalter described Discovery as an exploration of song structures and musical forms whereas Homework was \"raw\" electronic music.
